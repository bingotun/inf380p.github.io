# Project Update

I think Iâ€™m almost on the right path. I made the `SlideTurtle`s drop down in a specific order and added `score` object and make it work to display game state. I think I almost finished what I planned to do last week and also think I can work on adding sound next week.

According to what I have done, my plan changed a little bit.
## 11/17
Finish the basic layout of the game.
Get the basic behavior of the game to work.
## 11/24
Make the `SlideTurtle`s drop down in a specific order.
Add `score` object and make it work to display game state.
## 12/1
Add sound.
Add three levels.
Create the win/lose/play again screen.
Make the interface look nicer by adding more interactive effects.
## 12/9
Modify the code if needed and focus on the reflection.

# Reflection
For now, from my point of view, my code is a little unstructured. I think I need to work on the structure next and make it more readable, which will also help me check if anything is missing.
